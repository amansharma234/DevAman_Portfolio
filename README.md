## About Me

Hi there! I'm Aman Sharma, a passionate and driven React developer currently in the final semester of my undergraduate studies. My journey in the world of web development has been fueled by curiosity and a relentless desire to learn and grow.

I specialize in building dynamic and responsive web applications using the MERN stack. While my expertise lies in React, I'm always open to exploring new technologies and recently started diving into PHP.

When I'm not coding, you can find me unwinding to DHH tracks and old classical songs, which help me reduce stress and feel lively. Music, for me, is a reflection of real-life scenarios and a source of inspiration.
